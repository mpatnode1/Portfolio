Duuuude, your register’s short and it’s only been one customer. What’s going on with you man. You’re never like this. 
I would know, because as I mentioned before, my guy Asmodeus the High Wizard has been watching you for the past few weeks. 
Go take a walk, clear your head. Maybe give it another shot tomorrow, sport.
ENDING 3: I’m not mad, just disappointed.
