You put a scoop of ice cream, meant for the vanilla cones you DO sell, into a small soda cup. 
Then, you microwave a small amount of chocolate milkshake and drizzle it on top. It does not look appetizing. She won’t mind right? Her jaw is barely hanging on as it is…
Quest Success!
You’re not exactly sure how to ring this up. You decide on inputting it as an ice cream cone, it’s close enough anyways.
You are silently begging that the customer does not pay enough attention to the screen on her end to see that she is not, in fact, being charged for a hot fudge sundae.
“Your total is 5.46$” You tell her. She hands you a ten dollar bill. You type in the number on the register.
It alerts you that her change is 4.54$.
You start counting out the change from the register.
